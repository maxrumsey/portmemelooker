# PortMemeLooker
PortMemeLooker is a web app useful for enjoying memes that require you to look at the image from the charging point on a mobile device while on a desktop or laptop.

It's designed to be ran with GitHub Pages, but the dev server can be started with `nodemon`. (Make sure nodemon is installed!)
